# Placeholder Image Instructions

Since GitHub Copilot doesn't have the ability to create actual PNG files directly, I've created SVG placeholders instead that you can view and convert to PNG.

To convert the SVG files to PNG:

1. Open the SVG files in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot of each one
3. Save the screenshot as the appropriate filename (paperplane.png, 2.png, 3.png)
4. Place these files in the img/paperplane folder

Alternatively, you can use the placeholder_generator.html file to create and save the placeholder images:

1. Open placeholder_generator.html in a web browser
2. For each image shown, right-click and select "Save Image As..."
3. Save them with the appropriate filenames in the img/paperplane folder:
   - paperplane.png
   - 2.png
   - 3.png

You can replace these placeholder images with your actual Paperplane Project screenshots when they are available.
